Remote-Admin-ROBLOX [Alpha 0.02]
===================

Allows you to control multiple Admin Commands via your desktop. So, you don't need to be in-game. Want to know the best part? Well, this doesn't use ANY external libraries. It was created entirely in Netbeans with Java 8, no funky little addons to make life easier. However it may or may not work when compiled with Java 7.

Currently supports: ebkrAdmin and Kohl's Admin.
